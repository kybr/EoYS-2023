### Song Cycle

![](image/Chris-Kallmyer-Song-Cycle.jpg)

Song Cycle utilizes code-driven randomization to produce a never-ending poem that is at turns joyful, mundane, social, and humorous - a product of chance. The text speculates on the special relationship between architecture and music by proposing new scenarios for music beyond the concert hall. In this way, the piece functions as a work of speculative architecture by proposing alternative contexts as well as social/political/economic functions for music in culture. Song Cycle attempts to bring the kind of attention found in the concert hall back into the world

Song Cycle was commissioned in 2021 by the Los Angeles Philharmonic. Gustavo Dudamel Artistic Director. The piece was created with the LA Phil's Humanities Programs, which is supported by Linda and David Shaheen.

Song Cycle is exhibited at the MAT within the CNSI, UCSB as part of the Systemics Lab Experimental Curatorial Programming, established in 2023 by Professor Marko Peljhan.

### Equivalence

![](image/Yixuan-Li-Equivalence.png)

Equivalence is a collaborative project of Yixuan Li, Prof. George Legrady, and Prof. Dan C. Baciu. Equivalence is an audio-react interaction installation that creates an experience of real-time language visualization through natural language processing and Image Generative AI. Inspired by how utterances are structured, Equivalence transforms spoken languages into structures in 3D space and visualizes them in a continuously Chinese scrolling painting format. Specifically, Equivalence explores the relationship between grammar (structure) and words (content) in the construction of spoken languages, and maps this relationship into the artwork-creating process of using language analysis to construct image composition and then the stable diffusion model to construct image textures. The work also explores the relationship between Conceptual Art and Generative AI by exploring how ideas are shaped into artwork with step-by-step transitions.

### Inter-Play

![](image/Inter-Play-MAT-200A.png)

Inter-Play is a distributed group performance in different media.  Content is transferred and translated into different media by each of  the performers to create an emergent distributed result. Poetically, the work explores ideas around communication and translation, especially  through digital media, including between and across the senses,  emotions, speech, and ideas. In particular, this piece plays with the  idea of pattern formation and related meaning-making. The networked  performance also leverages problems around information transfer as  features, including latency, misunderstanding, data loss, and artifacts.

### Shadows

![](image/Deniz-Caglarcan-Shadows.jpg)

"Shadows" is a transdisciplinary artwork by Deniz Çağlarcan, featuring selected oil paintings from Güneş Çağlarcan’s "Shadow Collection". The piece contemplates the intricacies of human social connections, recognizing that while individuals have unique traits, they naturally seek relationships. Maslow's hierarchy of needs plays a key role in shaping the artwork, correlating social status with mental states. The artwork uses human figures to create texture, with the brain interpreting acrylic forms as body parts, shadows as directions, and figure mass as detail. Deniz enlarges these figures, enhancing details perceivable by the audience and establishing a narrative. The composition's flow applies a Schaefferian approach, linking gestures by syntactical content and unique morphology. Themes drawn from the paintings provide a formal, semantic structure. The audience's perception ultimately coalesces these elements into a unified artwork.

### Open Baby Monitor

![](image/CY-Open-Baby-Monitor.jpg)

My passion project as a new parent! Rather than buying more gear, why not repurpose old tech into a baby monitor that fits my needs? Here's the scoop:
- Web Access: Keep an eye on her crib from anywhere, on any device.
- Sleep Tracker: A deep-learning model checks whether she is in the crib and tracks her sleep quality.
- Camera Control: Swap video feeds for different lighting conditions, or even flash on some light.
- Secure: Password-protected.
- Wallet-friendly: All you need is an old Android phone and a computer.

### The Mayor

![](image/Stejara-Dinulescu-Mayor.jpg)

An army of drawing machines are hard at work, generating small  postcards that depict early visual elements of our show. Despite being  made by a robotic system, the prints retain hand-drawn characteristics  and serendipidious accidents that illustrate the sharing of autonomy  between human designer and executing machine. The mechanical sounds of  the drawing machines at work are captured and dispersed throughout  latent * ville.

### *Engaged Awareness*

![](image/Garrison-McCullough-Engaged.png){width=100%}

In this performance installation, the public is invited to consider the sensations of relationality. Dwelling in the precarious ritual of searching for suspension, we push until we find balance, to register how it feels, and adjust as we attune to emergent information. Informed as a restriction study we call ethered & tethered, this work exists in liminal spaces---between the pull of the ground and air, the digital and flesh---where we practice falling into and away. The amplification of the physiological attempts a plurality of expressions to enhance communication, a reaching towards. This piece is an extension of a recent performance collaboration Ryan and Danielle led in residency at the Milieux Research Institute in Montréal, where they co-created (with 40 artists) live feedback loops between heartbeat data collection, digital musical composition and experimental aerial movement which was performed live and online for over 500 audience members.

### *Echoes*

![](image/Paterakis-Manoudaki-Rosello-Echoes.jpeg){width=100%}

"Echoes" delves into the idea of liminal space, which lies between perception and meaning. While we use light waves to make sense of space, termites employ mechanical waves. The work connects these different stimuli - sound, space, and scent - in a transmodal experience. In this VR installation, a mound-like structure floats in darkness, causing disorientation. Using a microphone, the user can create echoes in the virtual space and manipulate the sound effects through movement in the liminal space. The olfactory artifact is used to guide the person through phase transitions with the aid of scent and sound. "Echoes" offers a captivating glimpse into the complexity of termites and their perception of space, and how this overlaps with our own.

### *S50_Synaptic_x2 (SIGGRAPH 2023 Excerpt)*

![](image/transLAB-S50_Synaptic_x2.png){width=100%}

\<S50_Synaptic_x2\> is the second excerpt of a much larger work-in-progress, the \<S50_Synaptic Time Tunnel\>, a major interactive installation for SIGGRAPH 2023, celebrating the 50th conference of this most famous of computer graphics conference series.

Fusing past (five decades of SIGGRAPH archival materials), present (live interactivity and generativity), and future (AI extrapolations of the past fifty years into the next fifty years), this project explores synaptic interconnections between the pioneering individuals, landmark ideas, technical innovations, breakthrough projects, and visionary artworks that carried the computer graphics revolution from the edge of research through the mainstream of global culture and into the restless invention of the future.

Imagining the past, present, and future of the SIGGRAPH archive as a dense evolving network of artificial neurons, dendrites, and synapses, and likening the spread of ideas to branching neural signals firing across countless synaptic connections like lightning, this data-driven project traces the propagation of influences and innovations across an ever-emerging field.

### *Krell Infinity Functor --- Application IX, Process Zero: Fractal Core Extraction (Version 6)* (8 minutes)

![](image/Ryan-Millett-KRELL.jpeg){width=100%}

*KRELL* is an algorithmic-generative music composition system implemented in the SuperCollider programming language. In this application, the *KRELL* system engages two parallel processes: one that indexes subsets from an infinite, self-similar integer sequence corresponding to microtonal pitch-modulation, and another that transforms synthetic audio generated by a neural network. Both processes approach infinity, though by dual means: one across a grid of discrete microtonal octave divisions, the other through a continuous 16-dimensional latent space.

### *Memory...memory...* (10 minutes)

![](image/Yvonne-Yuan-Memory.png){width=100%}

"Memory...memory..." is about the nature of our recollections. Memories dissipate like vapor, yet leave behind delicate droplets of remembrance. In this piece, I encode written/spoken memories into binary rhythms and weave together those precious moments of my twenty dear friends into a sound project. I am grateful that my friends trusted me and were willing to share a part of their lives with me. Through this work, memories are iterated, transformed, misaligned, lost, and found.

### *Study No. 2: Tremolo* (6 minutes)

![](image/Drew-Flieder-Tremolo.png){width=100%}

The title of this piece is derived from the fact that there are two "levels" of tremolo occurring throughout the piece. The first, lower level tremolo is generated by modulating the grain frequency of a pulsar generator with square waves. The second, higher level tremolo is between two lower level tremolo events.
