### *Engaged Awareness*

![](image/Garrison-McCullough-Engaged.png){width=100%}

In this performance installation, the public is invited to consider the sensations of relationality. Dwelling in the precarious ritual of searching for suspension, we push until we find balance, to register how it feels, and adjust as we attune to emergent information. Informed as a restriction study we call ethered & tethered, this work exists in liminal spaces---between the pull of the ground and air, the digital and flesh---where we practice falling into and away. The amplification of the physiological attempts a plurality of expressions to enhance communication, a reaching towards. This piece is an extension of a recent performance collaboration Ryan and Danielle led in residency at the Milieux Research Institute in Montréal, where they co-created (with 40 artists) live feedback loops between heartbeat data collection, digital musical composition and experimental aerial movement which was performed live and online for over 500 audience members.

### *Ceramic Artifacts Demonstrating Digital Systems Developed by the Expressive Computation Lab*

![](image/Bourgault-Toka-Frost-Ceramic.jpeg){width=100%}

Computational craft embraces forms of automation such as clay 3D printing and generative glazing patterns. With this collection of ceramics, we showcase artifacts made with a digital fabrication system for designing machine toolpaths and artifacts decorated with a novel surface decoration workflow.

![](image/Del-Valle-Toka-Aponte-PunchPrint.jpeg){width=100%}

PunchPrint is a new technique that combines 3D printing and punch needle embroidery to create a composite material that integrates the programmability of additive fabrication with the richness of traditional textile craft. This work showcases a set of artifacts made possible by the technique.

Osmosis, an immersive projection mapping installation, embodying the
essence of liminal space by seamlessly blending AI-generated visuals
with the urban environment. Like biological osmosis in biology, this
artwork envisions a transformative journey where virtual elements
permeate the building facade, blurring the boundaries between the
tangible and the virtual. Through its captivating exploration of AI's
creative potential, Osmosis invites contemplation on the evolving
relationship between technology and art in our interconnected world.

### *Echoes*

![](image/Paterakis-Manoudaki-Rosello-Echoes.jpeg){width=100%}

"Echoes" delves into the idea of liminal space, which lies between perception and meaning. While we use light waves to make sense of space, termites employ mechanical waves. The work connects these different stimuli - sound, space, and scent - in a transmodal experience. In this VR installation, a mound-like structure floats in darkness, causing disorientation. Using a microphone, the user can create echoes in the virtual space and manipulate the sound effects through movement in the liminal space. The olfactory artifact is used to guide the person through phase transitions with the aid of scent and sound. "Echoes" offers a captivating glimpse into the complexity of termites and their perception of space, and how this overlaps with our own.

### *S50_Synaptic_x2 (SIGGRAPH 2023 Excerpt)*

![](image/transLAB-S50_Synaptic_x2.png){width=100%}

\<S50_Synaptic_x2\> is the second excerpt of a much larger work-in-progress, the \<S50_Synaptic Time Tunnel\>, a major interactive installation for SIGGRAPH 2023, celebrating the 50th conference of this most famous of computer graphics conference series.

Fusing past (five decades of SIGGRAPH archival materials), present (live interactivity and generativity), and future (AI extrapolations of the past fifty years into the next fifty years), this project explores synaptic interconnections between the pioneering individuals, landmark ideas, technical innovations, breakthrough projects, and visionary artworks that carried the computer graphics revolution from the edge of research through the mainstream of global culture and into the restless invention of the future.

Imagining the past, present, and future of the SIGGRAPH archive as a dense evolving network of artificial neurons, dendrites, and synapses, and likening the spread of ideas to branching neural signals firing across countless synaptic connections like lightning, this data-driven project traces the propagation of influences and innovations across an ever-emerging field.

\* *This project is made possible by the generous support of the Autodesk Foundation.*

### *Krell Infinity Functor --- Application IX, Process Zero: Fractal Core Extraction (Version 6)* (8 minutes)

![](image/Ryan-Millett-KRELL.jpeg){width=100%}

*KRELL* is an algorithmic-generative music composition system implemented in the SuperCollider programming language. In this application, the *KRELL* system engages two parallel processes: one that indexes subsets from an infinite, self-similar integer sequence corresponding to microtonal pitch-modulation, and another that transforms synthetic audio generated by a neural network. Both processes approach infinity, though by dual means: one across a grid of discrete microtonal octave divisions, the other through a continuous 16-dimensional latent space.

### *Memory...memory...* (10 minutes)

![](image/Yvonne-Yuan-Memory.png){width=100%}

"Memory...memory..." is about the nature of our recollections. Memories dissipate like vapor, yet leave behind delicate droplets of remembrance. In this piece, I encode written/spoken memories into binary rhythms and weave together those precious moments of my twenty dear friends into a sound project. I am grateful that my friends trusted me and were willing to share a part of their lives with me. Through this work, memories are iterated, transformed, misaligned, lost, and found.

### *Study No. 2: Tremolo* (6 minutes)

![](image/Drew-Flieder-Tremolo.png){width=100%}

The title of this piece is derived from the fact that there are two "levels" of tremolo occurring throughout the piece. The first, lower level tremolo is generated by modulating the grain frequency of a pulsar generator with square waves. The second, higher level tremolo is between two lower level tremolo events.
